#US Primaries 2016: State Map Tutorial

In this tutorial we explain how to create your own us election map, how to replace the seed data with real data and how to tweak styles and colors.
<a href="http://www.datamap.io">Datamap</a> offers complete bundles containing everything you need to visualize the election results.
We use the <a href="https://elections.datamap.io/us/2016/primaries/states/iowa/republicans">2016 Republican Iowa Caucus Bundle</a> as our example.

##iFrame
Let's start with the easiest step, embedding <a href="https://elections.datamap.io/us/2016/primaries/states/iowa/republicans">this map</a> in your existing webpage. Add "iframe" at the end of the URL <a href="https://elections.datamap.io/us/2016/primaries/states/iowa/republicans/iframe">like so</a>.  

SAY HOW TO EMBED


##Download, unzip, open
Now that you know how to embed the Iowa datamap from elsewhere, you can also download the same map and open it locally. 

Go to <a href="https://elections.datamap.io/us/2016/primaries/states/iowa/republicans#what_you_get">page</a> and choose your price which ranges from free to $50. Then download rep_primary_iowa_2016.zip and unzip it. 

The folder structure looks now like this:

rep_primary_iowa_2016
    - index.html
    - README.txt
    ressources
       css
           datamap.css
       data
           candidates_rep_2016.json
           EMPTY_rep_primary_iowa_county_2016.csv
           SEED_rep_primary_iowa_county_2016.csv
       img
           ... photos of candidates
       js
           ... d3, topoJSON etc.
       map

HOW TO OPEN YOUR DATA VISUALIZATION?
====================================

After downloading and unzipping, open the folder.
To open the data visualization, click on the index.html file.

Most browsers prevent you from running the file, when you do not have a local or 
remote server involved.

FIREFOX, NO SERVER NEEEDED
If you have Firefox, your file should open in the browser and work immediately.


CHROME & SAFARI: A LOCAL SERVER NEEDED
If you have Chrome or Safari, you need to fire up a local web server first. 
We recommend http-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), 
but any server will do.
A web server is needed to skirt security restrictions loading data out of the 
local file system. On the command line, run:

http-server -p 8008 &

If you visit http://localhost:8008, you should now see the data visualization.


REMOTE SERVER
If you upload the unzipped bundle to any remote server, you can open the index.html 
file with any modern browser.


NOTE: Do not use old IE version to see data visualizations. They won't work.



REAL DATA, SEED DATA, EMPTY DATA
================================

REAL DATA
This is data which we acquired post election. On the download page, we always indicate
the source.

SEED DATA
Seed data is "FAKE" data, but mimics real data. The purpose of seed data is to see how 
your data visualization will look.

EMPTY DATA
This is the file where you can plug in the real data. Placeholders should make that easy.
If you are still not sure, compare with the seed data file, to see what to put in.
