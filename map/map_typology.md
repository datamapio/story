#MAP TYPOLOGY

##One Map: Map only
Map Layers:
- Area Units Shapes (e.g. States in a Country)
- Smaller Area Units (e.g. Counties in a State)
- Even Smaller Area Units (e.g. Precincts) => makes sense with semantic zooming
- Places as Points (lat/long)
- Places as Area Units 
- Traffic Systems (Roads, Railways, Flight Routes)
- Water (Rivers, Lakes etc.)


###Simple Map (mostly meant for orientation)
Simple Maps with Administrative Units and main points as location


##One Map: Datamaps
These maps are meant to show data

###Simple Maps showing data 
####Maps with Population Rings

####Maps with Bar Charts

####Maps with Pie Charts 


###Choropleth
Choropleth Maps map data to a color. Area units are then colored according to the data value.

###Cartogram

###Dot Distribution Map

###Proportional Symbol Map

###Contour/Isopleth/Isarithmic Map

###Dasymetric Map


###Hexbin Maps

###Raster Maps
e.g. Zurich


##Overview and Detail Map
Mostly simple maps with the location in the world and then inside the country or country and region.
The overview helps to locate the place.

##Small Multiples
E.g. Repeating Choropleth Maps to show different related datasets (e.g. candidates in New Hampshire)

##Maps in combination
###Maps and Tables

###Maps and Line Graphs

##Timeseries Maps
